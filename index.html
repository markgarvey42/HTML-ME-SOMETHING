                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>Initially, I had no interest in making music. It was something nice to hear in the 
                background every once in a while, but other than that, it was never something I 
                found solace in. That was until I downloaded GarageBand for my then iPhone 5c;
                </p>
                <p>I had no idea what I was doing, but thankfully that wasn't necessary. 
                This DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), made the process immensely facile. More so, It 
                almost felt like a video game believe it or not! I was just having fun with the program
                and eventually ended up with something you might consider a beat.
                Thus, Spicy Meatball was created.
