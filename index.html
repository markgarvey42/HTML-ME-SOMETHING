                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>Initially, I had no interest in making music. It was something nice to hear in the 
                background every once in a while, but other than that, it was never something I 
                found solace in. That was until I downloaded GarageBand for my then iPhone 5c;
                </p>
                <p>I had no idea what I was doing, but thankfully that wasn't necessary. 
                This DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), made the process immensely facile. More so, It 
                almost felt like a video game believe it or not! I was just having fun with the program
                and eventually ended up with something you might consider a beat.
                Thus, "Spicy Meatball" was created.

                <h2>My Newfound Passion</h2>
                <p>As I began to delve into music production, I realized there was a lot I would need
                to learn in order to create what I envisioned. The first step in achieving my goals
                was purchasing a beat sequencer, the Maschine Mikro MKII.
                </p>
                <img src="images/mikro_mkII.jpg" alt="A picture of the Maschine Mikro MKII" style="width:600px;height:300px;">
                <p>Most of what I created didn't receive the curtousy of being exported. Out of the dozens of
                instrumentals I created, only a handfull were eventually uploaded to my SoundCloud. One of my
                favorites being "Soap".
