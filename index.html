                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>Initially, I had no interest in making music. It was something nice to hear in the 
                    background every once in a while, but other than that, it was never something I 
                    found solace in. That was until I downloaded GarageBand for my then iPhone 5c;
                </p>
                <p>I had no idea what I was doing, but thankfully that wasn't necessary. 
                    This DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) made the process immensely facile. More so, It 
                    almost felt like a video game believe it or not! I was just having fun with the program
                    and eventually ended up with something you might consider a beat.
                    Thus, "Spicy Meatball" was created.

                <h2>My Newfound Passion</h2>
                <img src="images/mikro_mkII.jpg" alt="A picture of the Maschine Mikro MKII" style="width:600px;height:300px;">
                <p>As I began to delve into music production, I realized there was a lot I would need
                    to learn in order to create what I envisioned. The first step in achieving my goals
                    was purchasing a beat sequencer, the Maschine Mikro MKII.
                </p>
                <p>Most of what I created didn't receive the curtousy of being exported. Out of the dozens of
                    instrumentals I created, only a handfull were eventually uploaded to my SoundCloud. One of my
                    favorites being "Soap".

                <p>There was a moment where I thought I couldn't improve. I felt stuck. There was no
                    longer any clear direction of what I needed to learn. Rather than looking inward, 
                    I looked elsewhere for inspiration and knowledge. I had just recently made an instrumental, "Mood",
                    and my friend Kyle loved it. This was right around the time I started recording vocals, so Kyle immediately
                    asked if we could make a song with it. I was more than happy to and that's how we made our song, "Dark Cage Freestyle".

                <p>
                    I started out my journey making exclusively rap instrumentals. For a while, that was nice, but I craved
                    something more complex. I wanted to make something that showed the extent of my capabilities. This is when
                    I began tinkering with different genres entirely, such as EDM (Electronic Dance Music). Progressgive House
                    being the sub-genre that caught my attention. I made a few different songs and recently uploaded my favorite;
                    aptly named "Progressive House Song".
